# FitLit 

A site for tracking various data of users including user information, friends, step goals, sleep information, and hydration information.

## Background/About

Having a clear and concise overview of activity and tracking it over time is crucial for any fitness/activity related application. Using data fetched from an API, this application simulates viewing activities of random users over a 7 day period.

## APIs Used

- FitLit API

## Primary Technologies Used
- Webpack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Mocha Testing Framework & Chai Assertion Library
- [Fluid Meter Library](https://github.com/aarcoraci/fluid-meter)

## Next Steps
Additional enhancements could include:
- Animating the circle progress bars like the fluid meter
- Allowing the user to choose a date instead of defaulting to the most recent
- Add an activity tracking widget based on the unused data from [activity API](https://fitlit-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/activity)
- Allow users to create/remove widgets and/or customize their positioning
